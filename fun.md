# Game Rules and Guidelines

## Factions
- Only the base game factions, **Wehrmacht** and **USA**, are allowed.

## Gameplay Restrictions
- **Anti-Tank (AT) Gun and Pak Abuse:** 
  - You are prohibited from exploiting glitches that allow AT guns and Paks to skip their reload animations, causing them to fire faster than intended.
- **Sniper Limit:** 
  - Each team can deploy a maximum of 2 snipers.
- **Forbidden Mods:** 
  - Any mods that provide an unfair advantage are not allowed, including but not limited to:
    - Maphacks
    - Minimap reveal mods
    - Resource modification mods

## Prohibited Tactics
- **Cap Walking:** 
  - Do not exploit glitches to make units "teleport" by moving models to the next capture point.
- **Medic Exploit:** 
  - Do not intentionally bomb your own squads to have medics revive fallen models, thereby generating free squads.

## Permitted Actions
1. **Console Commands:** 
   - Any console commands available in ranked games can be used, such as those that adjust settings for better performance or increase zoom levels ("zoom hack").
2. **External Programs:** 
   - Programs that modify hotkeys, are allowed. (Eg. AutoHotkey)
3. **Tactical Alerts:** 
   - You may ping an enemy sniper by clicking the notification alert.
4. **Visual and Audio Modifications:** 
   - Texture mods, skin packs, and sound mods are permitted.

## Maps
- The map selection will be determined by the results of a poll. [Waiting for poll results](https://fknoobs.codeit.ninja/polls/map-pool).

## Match Procedures
1. **Pre-Match Requirement:** 
   - Each player must take a screenshot of their game before the match starts.
2. **Breaks Between Games:** 
   - Teams are allowed a maximum of a 15-minute break between games.
